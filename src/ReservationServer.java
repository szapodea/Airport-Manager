/**
 * The server can handle multiple clients simultaneously. It will track and record ticket sales by writing
 * to reservations.txt. A sample reservations file can be found in the Starter Code folder.
 * Your program will need to be able to create and write to a file in a similar format.
 * Example: Client 1 and Client 2 are both connected to the server and booking a Southwest flight.
 * If Client 1 books the last Southwest ticket, Client 2 should no longer be able to book it.
